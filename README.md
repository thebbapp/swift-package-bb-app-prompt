# ``BbAppPrompt``

User prompt and dialog management.

## Overview

The BbAppPrompt library provides an observable prompt system for displaying alerts, confirmations, and dialogs to users. It manages prompt state, queuing, presentation timing, and user response handling. This centralized prompt system ensures consistent user interaction patterns across the application and prevents multiple prompts from conflicting with each other.
